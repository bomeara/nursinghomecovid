It uses the readr, tidyverse, tidygeocoder, reactable, stringr, crosstalk, and leaflet packages.\nIt was made by Brian O’Meara. I’m a biologist, but this is outside my area of expertise: I do not know what vaccination rate is ideal in this setting, what covid rates are considered an acceptable tradeoff, biases in the reporting, and more. I’m just trying to make the data more accessible so that families can make informed decisions and journalists can dig into the data to see if there is anything of interest (facilities doing an exceptionally good or bad job, for example)."

    "text": "The US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services puts out a dataset of covid incidence, deaths, and vaccination at US nursing homes. The data are available at https://data.cms.gov/covid-19/covid-19-nursing-home-data. It has info on individual nursing homes, but it can be a little hard to use. I am making it more usable here, trying to make it easier for folks to see how people in nursing homes are being cared for. This uses federal data from the week ending 12/10/23. You can use the sliders below to filter facilities, zoom in on the map, and look at the table below. In the table you can start typing in any of the boxes to filter the data (i.e., type “NY” in the state box to get just nursing homes in New York state). On the map, click on a point to get all the data for that facility. Colors show the percent of healthcare staff up to date with covid vaccines: purple is highest, yellow is lowest. The map is zoomed out to show the whole country, but you can zoom in to see individual facilities.\n\n\n\nPercent of healthcare staff fully vaccinated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercent of residents fully vaccinated"
