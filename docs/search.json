From the FAQ at https://data.cms.gov/covid-19/covid-19-nursing-home-data:\nHow can there be more confirmed COVID-19 cases than beds in a nursing home?\nThe nursing home data posted reflects cumulative cases and deaths of COVID-19 reported in a facility. A nursing home may report more confirmed COVID-19 cases than beds because they may encounter a large number of admissions and discharges of residents with COVID-19, resulting in more cumulative cases of COVID-19 over time than the number of beds at any one time.\nThis may also be due to a data entry error on the part of the facility – for example, a nursing home may be entering cumulative numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases in a field where the facility should only be entering the number of new cases.\n\n\n\nNext is a plot of current covid cases in nursing homes."

The data are available at https://data.cms.gov/covid-19/covid-19-nursing-home-data. It has info on individual nursing homes, but it can be a little hard to use. I am making it more usable here, trying to make it easier for folks to see how people in nursing homes are being cared for. This uses federal data from the week ending 2024-12-01.\nThe tabs above have different views of the data. If you want to look at detail on a particular facility, it is probably easiest to use the map or table pages. Some quick summaries:\n\n4071 nursing homes have zero healthcare staff fully up to date on covid vaccines.\n71 nursing homes have all healthcare staff fully up to date on covid vaccines.\n7% of nursing home healthcare staff nationwide are fully up to date on covid vaccines.\n1780 nursing homes have zero residents fully up to date on covid vaccines.\n38 nursing homes have all residents fully up to date on covid vaccines.\n\n\nCurrent inferred covid infection rates\nThis is based on dividing the weekly number of cases in healthcare staff or residents by the number in that facility over the week. There may be a lot of biases here: for example, if not every resident and staff member is tested every week, especially if some facilities never test or report, then the rate will be too low. There may also be issues if, say, a resident or staff member moves between facilities – they could appear in the data twice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap of covid incidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap of vaccination status"

It uses the targets, readr, tidyverse, tidygeocoder, reactable, stringr, crosstalk, plotly, and leaflet packages.\nIt was made by Brian O’Meara. I’m a biologist, but this is outside my area of expertise: I do not know what vaccination rate is ideal in this setting, what covid rates are considered an acceptable tradeoff, biases in the reporting, and more. I’m just trying to make the data more accessible so that families can make informed decisions and journalists can dig into the data to see if there is anything of interest (facilities doing an exceptionally good or bad job, for example). I came across this dataset online and was surprised at how many facilities have no residents nor health care workers fully vaccinated against covid-19, given over 170,000 deaths in nursing homes in the US (as of Dec 22, 2023).\nTo get in touch with an issue, go to https://github.com/bomeara/nursinghomecovid/issues. For issues with the original data, go to https://data.cms.gov/covid-19/covid-19-nursing-home-data.\nTo run this yourself, go to https://github.com/bomeara/nursinghomecovid, clone the repository, and then source run.R from within R to run quarto to make the site. Make sure you have the packages listed above installed. This will download the data, process it in R, and make the site.\nTo use the original data, go to https://data.cms.gov/covid-19/covid-19-nursing-home-data and download the CSV file for the year you want. It should be able to be opened in Microsoft Excel, Apple Numbers, or similar. If you’re a journalist or researcher, please use the original data – I try to do minimal processing of the data, but it’s still not as secure as using the original.\n\nTo find a facility\n\nGo to table. You can search for the facility name, start typing it in the first column, or first filter by state or county.\n\n\n\nTo find information on a region\n\nOne approach is to go to table and filter by state or county.\nAnother approach is to go to map and zoom in on the region of interest.
