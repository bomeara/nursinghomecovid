From the FAQ at https://data.cms.gov/covid-19/covid-19-nursing-home-data:\nHow can there be more confirmed COVID-19 cases than beds in a nursing home?\nThe nursing home data posted reflects cumulative cases and deaths of COVID-19 reported in a facility. A nursing home may report more confirmed COVID-19 cases than beds because they may encounter a large number of admissions and discharges of residents with COVID-19, resulting in more cumulative cases of COVID-19 over time than the number of beds at any one time.\nThis may also be due to a data entry error on the part of the facility – for example, a nursing home may be entering cumulative numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases in a field where the facility should only be entering the number of new cases.\n\n\n\nNext are a histogram showing the counts of nursing homes with different proportions of healthcare staff or residents fully vaccinated fully vaccinated for covid."

The data are available at https://data.cms.gov/covid-19/covid-19-nursing-home-data. It has info on individual nursing homes, but it can be a little hard to use. I am making it more usable here, trying to make it easier for folks to see how people in nursing homes are being cared for. This uses federal data from the week ending 12/10/23.\nThe tabs above have different views of the data. Some quick summaries:\n\n6029 nursing homes have zero healthcare staff fully up to date on covid vaccines.\n72 nursing homes have all healthcare staff fully up to date on covid vaccines.\n3655 nursing homes have zero residents fully up to date on covid vaccines.\n95 nursing homes have all residents fully up to date on covid vaccines."

It uses the targets, readr, tidyverse, tidygeocoder, reactable, stringr, crosstalk, plotly, and leaflet packages.\nIt was made by Brian O’Meara. I’m a biologist, but this is outside my area of expertise: I do not know what vaccination rate is ideal in this setting, what covid rates are considered an acceptable tradeoff, biases in the reporting, and more. I’m just trying to make the data more accessible so that families can make informed decisions and journalists can dig into the data to see if there is anything of interest (facilities doing an exceptionally good or bad job, for example). I came across this dataset online and was surprised at how many facilities have no residents nor health care workers fully vaccinated against covid-19, given over 170,000 deaths in nursing homes in the US (as of Dec 22, 2023). To get in touch with an issue, go to https://github.com/bomeara/nursinghomecovid/issues. For issues with the original data, go to https://data.cms.gov/covid-19/covid-19-nursing-home-data.\nTo run this yourself, go to https://github.com/bomeara/nursinghomecovid, clone the repository, and then source run.R to run quarto to make the site.
