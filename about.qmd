This uses data from <https://data.cms.gov/covid-19/covid-19-nursing-home-data> .

The site is made with quarto and R: the source code is at <https://github.com/bomeara/nursinghomecovid> . It uses the readr, tidyverse, tidygeocoder, reactable, stringr, crosstalk, and leaflet packages.

It was made by Brian O'Meara. I'm a biologist, but this is outside my area of expertise: I do not know what vaccination rate is ideal in this setting, what covid rates are considered an acceptable tradeoff, biases in the reporting, and more. I'm just trying to make the data more accessible so that families can make informed decisions and journalists can dig into the data to see if there is anything of interest (facilities doing an exceptionally good or bad job, for example).
